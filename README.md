# Skin Cancer Classification 🩺🖼️

This project is a machine learning model built to **classify different types of skin cancer** from images.  
It demonstrates a full workflow — from importing data to training a deep learning model — inside [`model.ipynb`](https://github.com/NufalXBaalash/Skin_cancer_classification/blob/main/model.ipynb).

## 📚 Project Overview

Skin cancer is one of the most common forms of cancer worldwide.  
Early detection through AI-driven models can assist doctors and save lives.

In this project, a **Convolutional Neural Network (CNN)** is trained on skin lesion images to classify them into multiple cancer types.

## 🚀 How the Model Works

The full workflow is available in [model.ipynb](https://github.com/NufalXBaalash/Skin_cancer_classification/blob/main/model.ipynb):

1. **Import Libraries**  
   - TensorFlow, Keras, NumPy, Matplotlib, etc.

2. **Load Dataset**  
   - Skin lesion images are loaded and split into training and testing sets.

3. **Preprocessing**  
   - Images are resized, normalized, and augmented to improve generalization.

4. **Build the CNN Model**  
   - A custom Convolutional Neural Network is created with multiple Conv2D, MaxPooling2D, and Dense layers.

5. **Compile the Model**  
   - Using `Adam` optimizer and `categorical_crossentropy` loss.

6. **Train the Model**  
   - The model is trained over multiple epochs with validation steps.

7. **Evaluate the Model**  
   - Model accuracy and loss are visualized.
   - Final performance is measured on the test set.

8. **Save/Load Model** *(Optional)*  
   - Model saving techniques can be applied to preserve the trained weights.

## 📈 Results

- Achieved **good classification performance** on the dataset.
- Training and validation curves are plotted to analyze overfitting/underfitting.

(*You can add exact numbers or a confusion matrix here if you want.*)

## 🛠️ Requirements

- Python 3.8+
- TensorFlow / Keras
- NumPy
- Matplotlib
- Scikit-learn (optional)

Install all required libraries using:
